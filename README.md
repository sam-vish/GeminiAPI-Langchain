# Gemini API with Langchain

This repository demonstrates the integration of Gemini API with Langchain framework in a Google Colab notebook. It showcases various functionalities of the Gemini API in combination with Langchain for language model processing and interactions.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
!pip install -q langchain_experimental langchain_core
!pip install -q google-generativeai==0.3.1
!pip install -q google-ai-generativeLanguage==0.4.0
!pip install -q langchain-google-genai
!pip install -q "langchain[docarray]"
```
## Usage
The Google Colab notebook provides examples of using Gemini API and Langchain for different language model tasks. Here's a brief overview of what's included:

Setting up authentication and environment variables for the Gemini API.
Listing available models and their descriptions.
Generating text using the Gemini Pro model based on provided prompts.
Demonstrating various language model chains using Langchain:
Basic LLM Chain
Basic Multi Chain
More Complicated Chain - Mini RAG
Pal Chain (Problem Answering Language Chain)
Multi Modal (Combining Text and Image)
